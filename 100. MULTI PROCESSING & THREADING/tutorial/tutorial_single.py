On my laptop, this script took 19.4 seconds to download 91 images. Please do note that these numbers may vary based on
the network you are on. 19.4 seconds isnâ€™t terribly long, but what if we wanted to download more pictures? Perhaps 900
images, instead of 90. With an average of 0.2 seconds per picture, 900 images would take approximately 3 minutes.
For 9000 pictures it would take 30 minutes. The good news is that by introducing concurrency or parallelism,
we can speed this up dramatically.

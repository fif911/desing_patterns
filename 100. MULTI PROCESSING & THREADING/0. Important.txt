Queue - great thing built in in Python

from queue import Queue

queue.put((download_dir, link))
queue.get()
queue.task_done()
queue.join()

Tread - sharing memory with other treads
from threading import Thread

class DownloadWorker(Thread):
    def __init__(self, queue: Queue):
        Thread.__init__(self)
        self.queue = queue  # shared object between Threads in memory

    def run(self):
        # do job
        pass

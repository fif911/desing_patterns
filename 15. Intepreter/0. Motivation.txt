Interpreters are all around us. Even now, even in this very room

Interpreter - A component that processes structured text data. And does it by 2 stage process:
1. Lexing - turning code into separate lexical tokens
2. Parsing - interpreting sequences of tokens into object oriented structures

Interpreter DP is all about textual input mainly
You type code and somebody has to compile it

so we have this need of processing textual input. E.g. turning text into
object oriented structures
Compiler theory pretty complex topic
